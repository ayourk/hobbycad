Description: Open-source parametric 3D CAD for hobbyists
 HobbyCAD is a Linux-native parametric 3D solid modeler built on
 OpenCASCADE Technology (OCCT) and Qt 6.  It provides boundary
 representation (B-Rep) modeling with STEP, IGES, STL, and OBJ
 import/export, a tiered startup system that adapts to available
 GPU capabilities, and an embedded command-line terminal for
 scripting and batch operations.
 .
 HobbyCAD operates in three modes depending on the system:
 Full Mode (OpenGL 3.3+), Reduced Mode (no GPU required for
 file conversion and geometry operations), and Command-Line
 Mode (headless batch processing).
