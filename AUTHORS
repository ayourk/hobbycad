  HOBBYCAD / HOBBYMESH — AUTHORS
================================================================================

  This file lists all individuals who have contributed to the
  HobbyCAD and HobbyMesh projects.

  By submitting code, documentation, or other creative works that
  are merged into the main repository, contributors accept the
  copyright assignment policy described in project_definition.txt
  Section 12.5. In summary: all contributions merged into the main
  codebase are copyright-transferred to the project author to
  simplify licensing decisions.

  Contributors who do not wish to transfer copyright may publish
  modifications independently under the project's license terms
  (GPL 3.0), but such code will not be merged into the main
  codebase. See project_definition.txt Section 12.5 for full
  details.

  All contributors must acknowledge the contribution agreement
  (project_definition.txt Section 12.7) before their first
  contribution is accepted.
