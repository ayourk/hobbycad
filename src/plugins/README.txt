  src/plugins/README.txt — Plugin System (Future — Phase 3+)
=====================================================================

  Shared plugin infrastructure accessible to both the libraries
  (libhobbycad, libhobbymesh) and the application UIs (hobbycad,
  hobbymesh).

  Plugins will be discovered and loaded at runtime via a registry.
  The plugin API will be defined in Phase 3 alongside the Python
  scripting integration.

  Not yet implemented.  See project_definition.txt for the roadmap.
