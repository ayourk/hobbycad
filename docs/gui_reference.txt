================================================================================
  1. OVERVIEW
================================================================================

    HobbyCAD provides a full 3D viewport with interactive camera controls,
    a ViewCube for quick orientation changes, and various navigation aids.
    This document covers the GUI features and their options.

================================================================================
  2. 3D VIEWPORT
================================================================================

  2.1  Mouse Navigation
  ----------------------

    Middle-drag           Pan the view (translate camera)
    Shift + Middle-drag   Rotate the view (orbit around center)
    Scroll wheel          Zoom in/out

    The orbit center is updated when panning, so subsequent rotations
    and ViewCube clicks orbit around the new center point.


  2.2  Keyboard Navigation
  -------------------------

    Home                  Reset to isometric home view (animated)
    Up/Down arrows        Rotate around current axis (continuous)
    Left/Right arrows     Snap rotate 90 degrees around current axis
    PgUp/PgDn             Rotate around current axis (continuous)

    The rotation axis can be changed by clicking the colored orbit
    rings in the viewport (X=red, Y=green, Z=blue).


  2.2.1  Orbit Rings
  -------------------

    The orbit rings surround the ViewCube and provide quick rotation
    around each world axis. Each ring has two arrow buttons that
    rotate the view in opposite directions.

    Colors:
      Red     X-axis rotation
      Green   Y-axis rotation
      Blue    Z-axis rotation

    Arrow Direction Correction:
      The arrows automatically adjust their behavior based on camera
      orientation. When viewing from different angles, the arrows
      swap their rotation direction so that the visual direction
      (clockwise/counter-clockwise on screen) always matches the
      actual rotation. This ensures intuitive behavior from any
      viewing angle (top, bottom, front, back, left, right).


  2.3  ViewCube
  --------------

    The ViewCube is displayed in the upper-right corner of the viewport.
    Click on faces, edges, or corners to animate to that view orientation.

    Features:
    - Smooth animated transitions (~250ms)
    - Orbits around current center point (updated by panning)
    - Preserves zoom level during rotation
    - Correct text orientation on all faces
    - Respects Z-up or Y-up coordinate convention

    Face labels (Z-up convention):
      TOP       Camera at +Z looking down
      BOTTOM    Camera at -Z looking up
      FRONT     Camera at +Y looking toward -Y
      BACK      Camera at -Y looking toward +Y
      LEFT      Camera at -X looking toward +X
      RIGHT     Camera at +X looking toward -X


  2.4  Grid and Axes
  -------------------

    The viewport displays:
    - A rectangular grid on the XY plane (Z=0)
    - Axis trihedron at the origin (X=red, Y=green, Z=blue)
    - Negative axis extensions in matching colors

    The grid and axes are excluded from FitAll bounding box calculations,
    so they don't affect view framing when fitting to geometry.

    Grid properties:
      Extent:       100mm in each direction
      Minor lines:  10mm spacing (thin, gray)
      Major lines:  100mm spacing (thicker, lighter gray)

================================================================================
  3. VIEW MENU
================================================================================

  3.1  Panel Visibility
  ----------------------

    Terminal (Ctrl+`)     Show/hide the CLI terminal panel
    Project (Ctrl+R)      Show/hide the project/feature tree panel
    Properties (Ctrl+P)   Show/hide the properties panel
    Toolbar               Show/hide the viewport toolbar


  3.2  Workspace Selection
  -------------------------

    Workspace >           Submenu for workspace modes
      Design              Standard modeling workspace (default)
      Sketch              2D sketching workspace
      Simulation          Analysis and simulation workspace


  3.3  View Navigation
  ---------------------

    Reset View (Home)     Animate to isometric home position
    Rotate Left 90        Rotate view 90 degrees counterclockwise
    Rotate Right 90       Rotate view 90 degrees clockwise


  3.4  Grid Options
  ------------------

    Show Grid (Ctrl+Shift+G)
        Toggle grid visibility in the 3D viewport.
        Default: On

    Snap to Grid (Ctrl+G)
        Enable grid snapping for geometry creation.
        Only available when grid is visible.
        Default: Off


  3.5  Coordinate System
  -----------------------

    Z-Up Orientation
        Toggle between Z-up and Y-up coordinate conventions.
        Default: On (Z-up)

        Z-up (checked):
          Standard CAD/engineering convention.
          Z axis points up, XY is the ground plane.
          ViewCube shows TOP/BOTTOM on Z axis.

        Y-up (unchecked):
          Game engine/3D graphics convention.
          Y axis points up, XZ is the ground plane.
          ViewCube shows TOP/BOTTOM on Y axis.

        Changing this setting resets the camera to an appropriate
        isometric view for the new convention.


  3.6  Orbit Behavior
  --------------------

    Orbit Selected Object
        Toggle orbit center behavior for ViewCube rotations.
        Default: Off

        When Off:
          ViewCube rotates around the current pan position.
          Pan the view to change the orbit center.
          Home resets orbit center to origin.

        When On:
          If objects are selected, ViewCube rotates around
          the center of their combined bounding box.
          If nothing is selected, uses current pan position.

        This option is useful when working on a specific part
        of a complex model — select the part, then use the
        ViewCube to examine it from different angles.

================================================================================
  4. DOCK PANELS
================================================================================

    bindings can be customized. Each action can have up to three bindings.

    The bindings system is context-aware:
      - Global bindings are active in all contexts
      - Always-active contexts (File, Edit, View, Navigation, Viewport)
        are available regardless of current mode
      - Mode-specific contexts (Sketch, Design) are mutually exclusive
      - Same key can have different meanings in different contexts
        (e.g., E = "Rotate Canvas CW" in Sketch, "Extrude" in Design)

    Categories:
      Global        Command Search (/)
      File          New, Open, Save, Save As, Close, Quit

          When checked, Z axis points up (CAD/engineering).
          When unchecked, Y axis points up (game engine/3D graphics).
          Default: On

    Orbit Behavior:
      Orbit around selected object
          When checked, ViewCube rotations orbit around the center
          of selected objects instead of the pan position.
          Default: Off

================================================================================
  6. SKETCH MODE
================================================================================

  6.1  Creating a Sketch
  -----------------------

    Click the "Create Sketch" button in the toolbar to start a new sketch.
    A plane selection dialog appears with the following options:

    Sketch Plane:
      XY Plane (Top/Bottom)   Horizontal plane, default for most designs
      XZ Plane (Front/Back)   Vertical plane facing front
      YZ Plane (Left/Right)   Vertical plane facing side
      Angled Plane            Custom plane at any angle

    Plane Angle (for Angled Plane only):
      Rotate around           X, Y, or Z axis
      Angle                   Rotation in degrees (-180° to 180°)

    Offset from Origin:
      Distance (mm)           Offset along the plane's normal axis
                              Example: XY plane with offset 10 creates
                              the sketch at Z = 10

    The preview text shows the resulting plane equation, e.g.:
      "Sketch on XY plane at Z = 10"
      "Sketch on plane rotated 45° around X axis"

    Click OK to enter sketch mode on the selected plane, or Cancel
    to abort.


  6.2  Sketch Properties
  -----------------------

    While in sketch mode, the Properties panel shows:
      Name        Editable sketch name (default: Sketch1, Sketch2, etc.)
      Plane       Current plane (XY/XZ/YZ) - can be changed
      Offset      Distance from origin (read-only, set in creation dialog)
      Entities    Count of entities in the sketch

    Grid settings:
      Show Grid      Toggle grid visibility
      Snap to Grid   Enable snapping to grid intersections
      Grid Spacing   Distance between grid lines


  6.3  Finishing a Sketch
  ------------------------

    When done sketching, use the action bar at the bottom:
      Save        Save the sketch and return to 3D view
      Discard     Discard changes and return to 3D view

    Saved sketches appear as wireframe outlines in the 3D viewport,
    positioned on their selected plane at the specified offset.


  6.4  Sketch Plane Visualization
  --------------------------------

    When a sketch is selected in the timeline, the 3D viewport displays
    a visual representation of the sketch plane:

      - Semi-transparent blue rectangle showing plane orientation
      - Dashed crosshair at the plane center (origin)
      - Darker blue border outline
      - Plane positioned at the correct offset

    This visualization helps understand:
      - Which plane the sketch is on (XY, XZ, YZ, or angled)
      - The offset distance from origin
      - How the sketch relates to other geometry

    The plane visualization is automatically hidden when:
      - A different feature is selected
      - The timeline selection is cleared


  6.5  Sketch Drawing Tools
  --------------------------

    The sketch toolbar provides the following drawing tools:

    Geometry Tools:
      Line (L)          Draw straight lines between two points

      Note: Polygon, Slot, Ellipse, Spline, and Text do not yet show
      editable properties in the Properties panel.


  6.6  Trim, Extend, and Split Tools
  ------------------------------------

    These tools modify existing geometry at intersection points.

    Trim Tool:
      1. Activate the Trim tool from the toolbar
      2. Click on the segment of an entity you want to remove
      3. The segment between the nearest intersections is deleted
      4. For circles, trimming converts them to arcs

      Example: Draw two crossing lines. Click on one segment of a line
      where it crosses the other. That segment is removed, leaving the
      remaining portions.

    Extend Tool:
      1. Activate the Extend tool from the toolbar
      2. Click near the endpoint of a line you want to extend
      3. The line extends to the nearest intersection with another entity
      4. Currently supports extending lines to other lines, circles, or arcs

    Split Tool:
      The Split tool has intelligent behavior based on selection:

      No pre-selection (click to split):
        1. Activate the Split tool
        2. Click on an entity
        3. If intersections exist, the entity splits at ALL intersection points
        4. If no intersections, the entity splits at the click point

      Two entities pre-selected (targeted split):
        1. Ctrl+click to select a Point and a Line/Curve
        2. Activate the Split tool and click
        3. The line/curve splits at the point's location

        OR:

        1. Ctrl+click to select two intersecting entities
        2. Activate the Split tool and click
        3. BOTH entities split at their intersection point

      Splitting a circle converts it to arcs. Splitting a line creates
      multiple line segments.


  6.7  Constraints
  -----------------

    Constraints define geometric relationships between entities and control
    sketch dimensions. HobbyCAD uses the libslvs constraint solver.

    Dimensional Constraints:
      Distance        Distance between two points or point-to-line
      Radius          Circle or arc radius
      Diameter        Circle or arc diameter (2 × radius)
      Angle           Angle between two lines

    Geometric Constraints:
      Horizontal      Line is horizontal (parallel to X axis)
      Vertical        Line is vertical (parallel to Y axis)
      Parallel        Two lines are parallel
      Perpendicular   Two lines meet at 90°
      Coincident      Two points share the same location
      Tangent         Line/arc meets curve tangentially
      Equal           Two entities have equal length or radius
      Midpoint        Point lies at the midpoint of a line
      Symmetric       Two points are symmetric about a line

    Adding Constraints:
      1. Select the Dimension tool (D) for dimensional constraints
      2. Click on one or two entities to constrain
      3. Click to place the dimension label
      4. Enter the desired value in the dialog

    Constraint Visualization:
      - Satisfied constraints appear in blue
      - Unsatisfied constraints appear in red
      - Dimension labels show the value with units
      - Driven dimensions show values in parentheses and gray color


  6.8  Driving vs. Driven Dimensions
  ------------------------------------

    Dimensional constraints can be either Driving or Driven:

    Driving Dimensions (default):
      - Control the geometry
      - Changing the value moves the associated entities
      - Displayed normally with units

    Driven Dimensions (reference only):
      - Display-only, do not control geometry
      - Value updates automatically when geometry changes
      - Displayed in parentheses with gray color
      - Useful for showing calculated values

    Over-Constraint Prevention:
      When adding a dimension that would over-constrain the sketch,
      HobbyCAD displays a dialog:

        "This dimension would over-constrain the sketch."

        Options:
          - Create as Driven: Add as a reference dimension
          - Cancel: Do not add the dimension

      This prevents the sketch from becoming unsolvable.

    Converting Between Driving and Driven:
      1. Right-click on a dimension label
      2. Select "Make Driven (Reference)" or "Make Driving"
      3. Converting to Driving checks for conflicts first
      4. If conflicts exist, a warning shows which constraints conflict


  6.9  Grid and Snapping
  ------------------------

    The sketch canvas displays a grid for alignment and provides various
    snapping behaviors.

    Grid Display:
      - Grid is shown as light gray lines
      - Grid spacing adjusts automatically based on zoom level:
        - Zoomed out: grid lines are spaced further apart
        - Zoomed in: grid lines become more dense
      - This ensures the grid is always useful without being too cluttered

    Grid Controls:
      Show Grid (G)       Toggle grid visibility
      Snap to Grid        When enabled, points snap to grid intersections

    Snapping Behaviors:

      Grid Snap (when enabled):
        - Drawing points snap to nearest grid intersection
        - Applies during entity creation and handle dragging

      Force Snap (Shift key):
        - Hold Shift while dragging to force grid snap
        - Works even when global snap setting is off
        - Useful for occasional precise placement

      Axis Constraint (Ctrl + X/Y key):
        - Hold Ctrl and press X or Y during a drag
        - Movement is constrained to that axis only
        - Visual guide line appears showing the constraint
        - Release Ctrl to allow free movement again

      Combined Snap + Constraint (Shift + Ctrl):
        - Hold both Shift and Ctrl during drag
        - Snaps to grid AND constrains to axis
        - Creates a crosshair guide at the constrained position


  6.9.1  Construction Geometry
  -----------------------------

    Construction geometry is used for reference and layout but is not
    included in profiles for extrusion or other operations.

    Visual Appearance:
      - Dashed line style
      - Orange/brown color
      - Same selection and editing behavior as normal geometry

    Creating Construction Geometry:
      Method 1 - Right-click menu:
        1. Select an entity
        2. Right-click and choose "Make Construction Geometry"

      Method 2 - Properties panel:
        1. Select an entity
        2. In the Properties panel, check the "Construction" checkbox

      Method 3 - Bulk conversion:
        1. Ctrl+click to select multiple entities
        2. Right-click and choose "Make All Construction Geometry"

    Construction geometry is useful for:
      - Centerlines and reference lines
      - Layout guides
      - Symmetry axes
      - Temporary geometry for constraint targets


  6.10  Multi-Selection
  ----------------------

    Select multiple entities using various methods for bulk operations.

    Selection Methods:

      Click              Select single entity (deselects others)
      Ctrl+Click         Add entity to selection (or remove if already selected)
      Double-Click       Select chain of connected entities
      Click empty space  Clear all selections
      Escape             Clear selection (in Select mode)

    Window Selection (drag on empty space):

      Left-to-Right drag (Window mode):
        - Blue rectangle with solid border
        - Selects only entities FULLY ENCLOSED by the rectangle
        - Use for precise selection of specific entities

        - Green rectangle with dashed border
        - Selects entities that INTERSECT or are enclosed by the rectangle
        - Use for quick selection of entities in an area

      Modifier keys:
        - Hold Ctrl while releasing to ADD to existing selection
        - Without Ctrl, window selection replaces the current selection

    Chain Selection (Double-Click):

      Double-clicking on an entity selects all connected entities:
        - Finds entities with coincident endpoints
        - Recursively selects the entire chain
        - Useful for selecting a complete outline or profile

    Properties Panel (Multi-Selection):

      When multiple entities are selected, the Properties panel shows:
        - Selected count (e.g., "5 entities")
        - Type breakdown (e.g., "3 Lines, 2 Circles")
        - Common properties only
        - Construction checkbox (tri-state: all, none, or mixed)
        - Bounding box (min, max, size, center)

  6.13  Alignment Tools
  ----------------------

    Alignment tools arrange multiple selected entities relative to each other.

    Edge Alignment:
      Align Left      Move all entities so their left edges align
      Align Right     Move all entities so their right edges align

      Distribute Vertically     Space entities evenly top-to-bottom

    Distribution maintains the position of the first and last entities
    (by position) and moves the intermediate entities to create equal
    spacing. Requires at least 3 entities.


  6.14  Grouping
  ---------------

    Groups organize related entities for easier management.

    Creating a Group:
      1. Select multiple entities with Ctrl+click
      2. Right-click > "Group (N entities)"
      3. A named group is created (e.g., "Group 1")

    Future versions will support:
      - Selecting all group members by clicking one
      - Locking groups to prevent modification
      - Naming groups for organization


  6.15  Profile Detection
  ------------------------

    Profiles are closed loops of geometry that can be used for extrusion,
    revolve, and other operations.

    Automatic Detection:
      HobbyCAD automatically detects closed profiles formed by connected
      entities. Profiles are visualized with semi-transparent fills.

    Profile Requirements:
      - Entities must form a closed loop
      - Endpoints must be coincident (within tolerance)
      - Construction geometry is excluded from profiles

    Multiple Profiles:
      A sketch can contain multiple profiles. Nested profiles (holes)
      are detected automatically based on containment.

    Profile Visualization:
      - Outer profiles: Semi-transparent blue fill
      - Inner profiles (holes): Indicated by containment
      - Profile boundaries highlighted on selection


  6.16  Offset Tool
  ------------------

    The Offset tool creates parallel geometry at a specified distance from
    existing entities.

    Supported Entities:
      - Lines: Creates a parallel line at the specified offset distance
      - Circles: Creates a concentric circle with larger or smaller radius
      - Arcs: Creates a concentric arc with larger or smaller radius

    Usage:
      1. Select the Offset tool from the toolbar (O key)
      2. Click on the entity to offset
      3. Enter the offset distance in the dialog
      4. The offset direction is determined by which side of the entity
         you clicked on

    Notes:
      - For circles/arcs, clicking outside creates larger radius,
        clicking inside creates smaller radius
      - Minimum radius is enforced (0.1mm) to prevent invalid geometry


  6.17  Fillet Tool
  ------------------

    The Fillet tool creates rounded corners at the intersection of two lines.

    Usage:
      1. Select the Fillet tool from the toolbar (F key)
      2. Click on a line near the corner you want to round
      3. Enter the fillet radius in the dialog
      4. An arc is created at the corner, and the lines are trimmed

    Requirements:
      - Two lines must share a common endpoint (within tolerance)
      - The fillet radius must not exceed the length of either line

    Result:
      - The original lines are shortened to the tangent points
      - A smooth arc connects the two lines at the corner


  6.18  Chamfer Tool
  -------------------

    The Chamfer tool creates beveled (angled) corners at the intersection
    of two lines.

    Usage:
      1. Select the Chamfer tool from the toolbar
      2. Click on a line near the corner you want to chamfer
      3. Enter the chamfer distance in the dialog
      4. A straight line replaces the corner

    Requirements:
      - Two lines must share a common endpoint (within tolerance)
      - The chamfer distance must not exceed the length of either line

    Result:
      - The original lines are shortened by the chamfer distance
      - A diagonal line connects the two new endpoints


  6.19  Rectangular Pattern
  --------------------------

    Creates copies of selected entities arranged in a rectangular grid.

    Usage:
      1. Select the RectPattern tool from the toolbar
      2. Click on an entity to select it (Ctrl+click for multiple)
      3. Configure the pattern in the dialogs:
         - Number of copies in X direction
         - Number of copies in Y direction
         - Spacing in X direction (mm)
         - Spacing in Y direction (mm)

    Result:
      - Creates (X × Y - 1) copies of the selected entities
      - Original entities remain at their position
      - New copies are added to the selection


  6.20  Circular Pattern
  -----------------------

    Creates copies of selected entities arranged in a circular pattern
    around a center point.

    Usage:
      1. Select the CircPattern tool from the toolbar
      2. Click on an entity to select it (Ctrl+click for multiple)
      3. Configure the pattern in the dialogs:
         - Center X coordinate (mm)
         - Center Y coordinate (mm)
         - Total number of copies (including original)
         - Total angle (degrees, 360 for full circle)

    Result:
      - Creates (count - 1) copies of the selected entities
      - Copies are evenly distributed around the center point
      - Arc start angles are adjusted to maintain proper orientation


  6.21  Project Tool
  -------------------

    The Project tool allows projecting geometry from external sources onto
    the current sketch plane. This is useful for referencing geometry from
    other parts of the model.

    Sources for Projection:
      - Other sketches in the same document
      - 3D model edges onto the 2D sketch plane
      - Construction planes and reference geometry

    Current Status:
      The Project tool infrastructure is in place. Full implementation
      requires integration with the document model and 3D geometry
      projection algorithms.

    Future Features:
      - Project edges from 3D bodies
      - Project intersection curves
      - Project sketch geometry from other sketches
      - Automatic update when source geometry changes
