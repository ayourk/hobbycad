================================================================================
  1. PROJECT VISION
================================================================================

A Linux-native, open-source, parametric 3D CAD application for
hobbyists, by hobbyists. HobbyCAD is built for mechanical
engineering, product design, and maker fabrication — delivering
professional-quality tools without requiring proprietary software,
subscription fees, or cloud lock-in.

Key principles:

  - Linux-first development (no Windows/macOS port-back compromises)
  - For hobbyists, by hobbyists — professional-quality results
    without the professional price tag
  - Offline-first: version control integration is HobbyCAD's cloud
    connectivity. All collaboration and sharing flows through git
    and GitHub/GitLab, not a proprietary cloud backend
  - Open-source with an open file format strategy
  - Modern, responsive UI built with Qt 6
  - Powered by OpenCascade Technology (OCCT) for industrial-grade
    solid modeling
  - Parametric design with a full 2D constraint solver
  - Support for STEP, STL, and OBJ file formats at launch

================================================================================
  2. TARGET USERS
================================================================================

  Primary Audience:

    Hobbyists and Makers
    - 3D printing enthusiasts who need parametric solid modeling
    - Electronics hobbyists designing enclosures and mechanical parts
    - Home workshop users with CNC routers or laser cutters
    - Users who want a capable CAD tool without subscription costs

    Linux-Native Engineers and Designers
    - Professional and semi-professional engineers who prefer Linux
      as their primary operating system
    - Users frustrated by running Windows CAD tools through VMs or Wine
    - Teams working in Linux-heavy environments (robotics, embedded
      systems, scientific computing)

  Secondary Audience:

    Open-Source Advocates
    - Users who prefer open-source tools on principle
    - Organizations with policies requiring auditable, open-source
      software

    Educators and Students
    - Instructors teaching CAD/CAM in Linux lab environments
    - Students who cannot afford commercial CAD licenses

================================================================================
  3. CORE USE CASES
================================================================================

  UC-01: Parametric Part Design
  -----------------------------
  The user creates a 3D solid part using parametric sketches and
  features (extrude, revolve, fillet, chamfer, pattern, etc.). Design
  parameters can be modified at any point, and the model updates
  accordingly through the feature history tree.

  UC-02: Assembly Design
  ----------------------
  The user combines multiple parts into an assembly with mates and
  constraints (coincident, concentric, distance, angle). Interference
  detection highlights collisions between parts.

  UC-03: Export for 3D Printing
  -----------------------------
  The user exports a solid model as STL or OBJ for slicing and 3D
  printing. Mesh density and tolerance settings are adjustable.

  UC-04: STEP File Interchange
  ----------------------------
  The user imports STEP files from other CAD systems for modification
  or reference. The user exports designs as STEP for sharing with
  collaborators using different CAD software.

  UC-05: 2D Drawing Generation
  ----------------------------
  The user generates 2D orthographic projections (front, top, side,
  isometric) from a 3D model with dimensions and annotations for
  manufacturing documentation. (Future release)

  UC-06: Enclosure Design for Electronics
  ----------------------------------------
  The user imports a PCB outline (from KiCad DXF export or STEP) and
  designs a custom enclosure around it, with cutouts for connectors,
  mounting bosses, and snap-fit features.

  UC-07: Reverse Engineering / Modification
  ------------------------------------------
  The user imports an STL or OBJ mesh from a 3D scan, uses it as a
  reference, and creates new parametric geometry around or based on
  the imported shape.

  UC-08: Multi-Body Part Design
  -----------------------------
  The user creates multiple solid bodies within a single part file,
  using Boolean operations (union, subtract, intersect) to combine
  them into a final shape. Any body can be flagged as a
  "construction body" — used as reference geometry for booleans,
  splits, and clearance checks but excluded from mass properties
  and export by default. See project_definition.txt Phase 2 for
  construction body details.

  UC-09: Mesh to B-Rep Conversion (STL/OBJ to STEP)
  ---------------------------------------------------
  The user imports an STL or OBJ mesh file and converts it (fully or
  partially) into B-Rep solid geometry suitable for export as STEP.
  This is a notoriously difficult problem — no existing CAD software
  performs this reliably for arbitrary geometry. HobbyCAD would offer
  this as a phased capability:

    Phase 1: Interactive/assisted conversion where the user manually
    selects mesh regions and specifies surface types (plane, cylinder,
    sphere, NURBS) to guide the conversion.

    Phase 2: Semi-automatic detection using curvature-based mesh
    segmentation to suggest regions and surface types, with user
    review and correction.

    Phase 3: Fully automatic conversion for simple prismatic parts
    (boxes, cylinders, plates with holes) as a long-term research
    goal.

  Even a Phase 1 implementation would be a significant differentiator,
  as no open-source CAD tool currently offers an integrated mesh-to-
  B-Rep workflow.

================================================================================
  7. DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGY
================================================================================

  To compete effectively in this landscape, HobbyCAD should focus on
  the following differentiators:

  7.1  Linux-First Design Philosophy
  -----------------------------------
  Unlike FreeCAD (which is cross-platform first) or Fusion 360 (which
  ignores Linux entirely), HobbyCAD would be designed and optimized
  for Linux from the ground up. This means native integration with
  Linux desktop environments, proper use of system theming, and
  leveraging Linux-specific advantages in performance and stability.

  7.2  Modern, Consistent UI
  ---------------------------
  FreeCAD's greatest weakness is its inconsistent, dated UI across
  workbenches. A clean, modern Qt 6 interface with consistent behavior
  throughout the application would be a significant differentiator.
  The UI should be intuitive for users coming from Fusion 360 or
  SolidWorks.

  7.3  Offline-First, Version Control as Cloud
  ----------------------------------------------
  Unlike Fusion 360 and Onshape, which require proprietary cloud
  backends for collaboration and version history, HobbyCAD works
  entirely offline with local file storage. Version control is
  HobbyCAD's cloud connectivity — all collaboration, sharing, and
  project history flows through git and GitHub/GitLab, using
  infrastructure the open-source community already uses and trusts.

  All supported file formats are open standards (STEP, STL, OBJ),
  ensuring users are never locked into a proprietary ecosystem.

  The native project format is a plain directory of text-based files
  (JSON manifest, BREP geometry, JSON sketches/features, Python
  scripts) — fully inspectable, hand-editable, and version-control
  friendly. Built-in git integration allows users to manage project
  history, collaborate, and share via GitHub/GitLab directly from
  the application. See project_definition.txt Section 5.2-5.5 for
  project format and version control details.

  7.4  Focused Feature Set
  -------------------------
  Rather than trying to match FreeCAD's breadth of workbenches (many
  of which are half-finished), HobbyCAD would focus on doing core
  mechanical CAD exceptionally well: parametric part design, assemblies,
  and manufacturing-ready output. Depth over breadth.

  7.5  Clean Architecture
  ------------------------
  Built from scratch on OCCT + Qt 6 with a clean, modern C++ codebase.
  No legacy technical debt. Designed for extensibility from day one
  with a well-documented plugin API and Python scripting interface.

  7.6  Hardware Design Integration
  ---------------------------------
  Special attention to workflows common among electronics hobbyists
  and engineers: importing PCB outlines from KiCad, designing
  enclosures with precise connector cutouts, and exporting for 3D
  printing or CNC machining. This bridges the gap between EDA and
  MCAD tools.

  7.7  Mesh-to-B-Rep Conversion (eventually Mesh-to-STEP)
  -----------------------------
  No existing CAD software — open-source or commercial — reliably
  converts triangulated mesh data (STL/OBJ) into proper B-Rep solid
  geometry (STEP). This is a fundamental unsolved problem in CAD,
  and even a partially capable implementation would be a unique
  selling point. HobbyCAD would approach this incrementally, starting
  with interactive/assisted tools for simple prismatic geometry and
  progressing toward semi-automatic and eventually automatic detection
  for common analytical shapes. This feature directly serves the 3D
  printing and 3D scanning communities, who frequently need to modify
  mesh-only models but have no path to proper solid geometry today.

================================================================================
  8. RISKS AND CHALLENGES
================================================================================

  8.1  Development Complexity
  ----------------------------
  Building a CAD application is one of the most complex software
  engineering tasks. The geometric kernel, constraint solver, and
  parametric engine each represent years of development effort.
  Leveraging OCCT and existing solver libraries mitigates this
  significantly but does not eliminate it.

  8.2  Competing with FreeCAD
  ----------------------------
  FreeCAD has a 20+ year head start and a large community. HobbyCAD
  must clearly articulate why it exists alongside FreeCAD rather than
  contributing to it. The answer lies in the clean-slate architecture
  and focused scope.

  8.3  OCCT Learning Curve
  -------------------------
  OpenCascade Technology has a notoriously steep learning curve and
  inconsistent documentation. Developer onboarding will be slower
  than with more modern libraries. The FreeCAD codebase can serve as
  a practical reference for OCCT integration patterns.

  8.4  Sustainability
  --------------------
  Open-source CAD projects require sustained developer commitment.
  Without a funding model (donations, dual licensing, commercial
  support tier), the project risks stalling. A clear sustainability
  plan should be established early.

  8.5  File Format Compatibility
  -------------------------------
  Real-world CAD workflows depend on reliable file interchange. STEP
  is the primary open standard, but many users also need DWG, DXF,
  and proprietary format support. The phased file format strategy
  outlined in Section 4 addresses this incrementally.

  8.6  GPU Driver Variability on Linux
  -------------------------------------
  OpenGL/Vulkan performance varies significantly across Linux GPU
  drivers (NVIDIA proprietary, NVIDIA open kernel, Mesa/AMD, Mesa/
  Intel). Thorough testing across driver stacks is essential.

  HobbyCAD mitigates GPU variability with tiered startup modes:
  Full Mode (OpenGL 3.3+), Reduced Mode (below 3.3, GUI without 3D
  viewport, 2D sketch editing via QPainter), and Command-Line Mode
  (no display). See project_definition.txt Section 13.1 for details
  on startup sequence, diagnostic dialog, and GPU vendor-specific
  recommendations.

  9. HOBBYMESH: COMPANION MESH EDITING TOOL
================================================================================

  9.1  BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
  -------------------------------

  Autodesk Meshmixer was a lightweight, powerful mesh editing and 3D
  printing preparation tool that occupied a unique niche between heavy
  CAD suites and artist-oriented sculpting applications. Created in
  2009 by Ryan Schmidt as a PhD research project at the University of
  Toronto, it was acquired by Autodesk on October 31, 2011 and placed
  in their 123D product family. It became the go-to "Swiss Army Knife"
  for anyone working with triangle meshes — hobbyists, engineers,
  jewelers, dental labs, and 3D printing service bureaus all relied on
  it daily.

  Autodesk has ceased active development of Meshmixer. While it remains
  available for download, it receives no updates, no bug fixes, and no
  new features. Autodesk has stated that Meshmixer's capabilities are
  being gradually absorbed into Fusion 360, but the integration has
  been slow, incomplete, and locked behind Fusion's subscription model
  and cloud dependency.

  Critically, Meshmixer was never properly available on Linux.
  Experimental Linux builds (versions 2.7 and 2.9) were briefly
  offered via .deb packages around 2015, but these were pre-Meshmixer
  3.0 and lacked many of the features that made Meshmixer essential.
  The experimental Linux builds were discontinued before Meshmixer 3.0
  shipped. No native Linux build was ever released for version 3.x;
  the only option on Linux has been running the Windows version under
  Wine, which is fragile and unsupported.

  No open-source tool has adequately filled this gap. MeshLab is the
  closest equivalent but focuses on mesh processing and analysis rather
  than interactive editing and 3D print preparation. Blender can
  perform many of these tasks but is vastly more complex than necessary
  for mesh prep workflows.

  HobbyMesh would be a standalone companion application (or plugin)
  built from the HobbyCAD codebase, specifically targeting the mesh
  editing and 3D printing preparation workflows that Meshmixer served.

  9.2  RELATIONSHIP TO HOBBYCAD
  ------------------------------

  HobbyMesh would share the HobbyCAD codebase and libraries but serve
  a distinct purpose:

    HobbyCAD: Parametric B-Rep solid modeling (design from scratch)
    HobbyMesh: Triangle mesh editing and preparation (fix/modify
               existing models)

  Implementation options:

    Option A - Standalone Application:
      A separate executable built from the shared codebase. Uses the
      same Qt 6 UI framework and OCCT mesh handling, but with a
      streamlined interface focused entirely on mesh operations. Users
      install it independently of HobbyCAD.

    Option B - HobbyCAD Plugin/Workbench:
      A mesh editing mode within HobbyCAD itself, activated when the
      user imports a mesh file. This keeps everything in one
      application but risks bloating the HobbyCAD UI.

    Option C - Both:
      Build the mesh editing functionality as a shared library that
      can be loaded either as a HobbyCAD plugin or wrapped in a
      standalone lightweight UI. This maximizes code reuse and gives
      users the choice.

  Recommended: Option C (shared library with both interfaces).

  9.3  CORE FEATURES (Meshmixer Equivalent)
  -------------------------------------------

  The following features replicate the core Meshmixer workflows that
  users depend on. They are grouped by priority.

  Priority 1 - Mesh Repair and Analysis:

    Inspector / Auto-Repair
      Scan the mesh for common defects: holes, non-manifold edges,
      flipped normals, degenerate triangles, self-intersections, and
      disconnected shells. Highlight problems visually and offer
      one-click repair.
      Libraries: OCCT (ShapeFix), CGAL (Polygon Mesh Processing),
      or custom implementation using OpenMesh/libigl.

    Hole Filling
      Fill holes in the mesh with options for minimal fill (flat cap),
      smooth fill (curvature-blended), or custom fill. Critical for
      making meshes watertight for 3D printing.

    Normal Repair
      Detect and fix inconsistent face normals. Ensure all normals
      point outward for a consistent solid.

    Manifold Repair
      Detect and resolve non-manifold edges and vertices that prevent
      proper slicing.

  Priority 2 - Mesh Editing:

    Selection Tools
      Select vertices, edges, or faces by click, brush, lasso, or
      connected region. Support for grow/shrink selection, select by
      angle, and select by face group.

    Mesh Sculpting
      Interactive brushes for sculpt, smooth, inflate, pinch, flatten,
      and crease. Adaptive remeshing adds or removes triangles as
      needed during sculpting.

    Extrude / Offset
      Extrude selected faces along their normals. Offset surfaces
      inward or outward to add wall thickness.

    Boolean Operations
      Union, difference, and intersection on mesh objects. Essential
      for cutting holes, embossing text, or combining parts.

    Plane Cut
      Slice a mesh with an infinite plane, keeping one or both halves.
      Useful for splitting large models for printing or creating
      flat bases.

    Mesh Simplification / Decimation
      Reduce triangle count while preserving shape and detail. Critical
      for reducing file size of high-poly scans.

    Remeshing
      Regenerate the mesh with uniform or adaptive triangle
      distribution. Produces cleaner geometry for downstream
      operations.

  Priority 3 - 3D Printing Preparation:

    Make Solid
      Convert any mesh (even non-manifold or with internal geometry)
      into a guaranteed watertight solid. This was Meshmixer's most
      loved feature. Implementation involves voxelization followed by
      marching cubes or dual contouring surface extraction.
      Libraries: CGAL (voxelization), OpenVDB, or custom
      implementation.

    Hollowing
      Carve a uniform internal cavity to reduce material usage for
      resin/powder printing. Add user-placed vent/drain holes.

    Wall Thickness Analysis
      Color-map the mesh by wall thickness to identify areas that are
      too thin to print successfully.

    Support Generation
      Generate tree-style support structures that use less material
      and snap off cleanly. Editable support points with adjustable
      contact size. This was another standout Meshmixer feature.

      Note: Tree supports are now a standard feature in PrusaSlicer,
      OrcaSlicer, and their derivatives. HobbyMesh's support
      generation should focus on use cases where slicer-generated
      supports are insufficient (e.g., resin printing, manual
      placement for delicate geometry, custom contact sizes).

      SLICER INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITY: The Slic3r/PrusaSlicer/
      OrcaSlicer family shares a common C++ slicing core called
      libslic3r, which can theoretically be built as a standalone
      library. libslic3r handles slicing, infill generation, support
      structure creation, and G-code path planning. All three slicers
      are licensed under AGPL 3.0, which is compatible with
      HobbyMesh's GPL 3.0 license.

      However, libslic3r was not designed as a clean embeddable
      library — it has extensive dependencies (Boost, TBB, Clipper,
      wxWidgets build system entanglement) and no published stable
      API for external consumers. Multiple developers have attempted
      to build it standalone with limited success. Integration would
      require significant effort to extract the relevant algorithms
      (support generation, overhang detection, orientation
      optimization) from the full slicer codebase.

      More practical integration approaches:
        - CLI subprocess: invoke PrusaSlicer/OrcaSlicer's command-
          line interface for slicing operations. All three slicers
          support headless batch slicing via CLI.
        - 3MF round-trip: export from HobbyMesh as 3MF with print
          settings, open in the user's preferred slicer.
        - Algorithm reference: study libslic3r's tree support and
          overhang detection algorithms and reimplement the relevant
          portions in HobbyMesh's own codebase (permitted under
          AGPL 3.0 with proper attribution).

      The CLI subprocess approach is recommended for initial
      integration — it requires no library dependency and works
      with whatever slicer the user has installed.

    Orientation Optimizer
      Test rotations to find the optimal print orientation that
      minimizes support area, print height, or overhangs.

    Mesh Slicing / Splitting
      Split a model into pieces that fit within a printer's build
      volume. Add alignment pins/keys at cut boundaries for assembly.

  Priority 4 - Mesh Combining and Transformation:

    Mesh Mix (Drag-and-Drop Combine)
      Attach one mesh to another with automatic blending at the
      boundary. The signature Meshmixer feature for creative model
      mashing.

    Mesh Alignment
      Align two meshes using point-pair registration or ICP
      (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm. Useful for assembling
      multi-part scans.

    Stamping / Embossing
      Apply text or patterns onto mesh surfaces. Useful for labeling
      parts or adding texture.

    Mirror / Symmetry
      Mirror a mesh across a plane. Create symmetric models from
      half-models.

  9.4  FILE FORMAT SUPPORT
  -------------------------

    Format    Direction      Notes
    ------    ---------      -----
    STL       Import/Export  Primary format (binary default; auto-
                             converted to ASCII .stla when project
                             is placed under version control for
                             diff-friendliness). Recognizes .stl,
                             .stla, and .stlb extensions on import.
    OBJ       Import/Export  With material/texture support
    PLY       Import/Export  Point cloud and mesh with attributes
    3MF       Import/Export  Modern 3D printing format
    AMF       Import/Export  Additive manufacturing format

                             (links to HobbyCAD's conversion feature)

  9.5  LIBRARIES AND DEPENDENCIES
  --------------------------------

  HobbyMesh shares the HobbyCAD core libraries and adds:

    +---------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------+
    | Function                  | Library                     | License   |
    +---------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------+
    | UI Framework              | Qt 6 (shared with HobbyCAD) | LGPL 3.0  |
    | Mesh I/O                  | Assimp                      | BSD       |
    | Mesh Processing           | CGAL (Polygon Mesh Proc.)   | GPL 3.0+  |
    | Mesh Data Structure       | OpenMesh or libigl          | BSD       |
    | Voxelization              | OpenVDB                     | MPL 2.0   |
    | Mesh Repair               | MeshFix or custom           | GPL 2.0   |
    | 3D Viewport               | OpenGL 3.3+ via Qt          | -         |
    | Sculpting / Remeshing     | Custom (based on libigl)    | BSD       |
    +---------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------+

  Note: The GPL licensing of CGAL and MeshFix would affect the license
  of HobbyMesh. If built as a standalone tool, this is straightforward
  (license HobbyMesh under GPL). If integrated as a HobbyCAD plugin,
  the GPL implications for the host application must be considered.

  9.6  COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
  -----------------------------

  HobbyMesh vs. Meshmixer:
    - Open-source (Meshmixer is proprietary freeware, abandoned)
    - Linux-native (Meshmixer was Windows/macOS only; experimental
      Linux builds were limited to v2.7/2.9 and discontinued before
      the 3.x series)
    - Actively developed (Meshmixer receives no updates)
    - Integrated with a parametric CAD tool (Meshmixer was standalone)
    - Mesh-to-STEP pipeline (Meshmixer had no B-Rep conversion)

  HobbyMesh vs. MeshLab:
    - Focused on interactive editing and 3D print prep (MeshLab is
      more academic/processing-oriented)
    - Simpler, more intuitive UI for common tasks
    - Integrated sculpting tools (MeshLab has no sculpting)
    - 3D printing specific features (support generation, hollowing,
      orientation optimization)

  HobbyMesh vs. Blender:
    - Dramatically simpler for mesh prep tasks (Blender's complexity
      is overkill for mesh editing/repair)
    - Purpose-built for 3D printing workflows
    - Lower learning curve for the target audience
    - Lightweight and fast-launching

  The combination of HobbyCAD (parametric design) + HobbyMesh (mesh
  editing and print prep) would provide a comprehensive open-source
  Linux-native workflow from design through manufacturing preparation,
  with no equivalent in the current open-source ecosystem.

  9.7  LONG-TERM GOAL: SLICER LIBRARY INTEGRATION
  --------------------------------------------------

  HobbyMesh aims to eventually integrate slicing capabilities as a
  plugin, eliminating the need for users to switch to a separate
  slicer application for basic 3D printing workflows.

  The target is the libslic3r slicing core shared by the Slic3r →
  PrusaSlicer → Bambu Studio → OrcaSlicer lineage. This library
  contains battle-tested algorithms for slicing, infill generation,
  tree support generation, overhang detection, G-code path planning,
  and orientation optimization. All are licensed under AGPL 3.0.

  PHASED APPROACH:

    Phase A — CLI subprocess (initial, low effort):
      Invoke the user's installed slicer (PrusaSlicer, OrcaSlicer,
      or any Slic3r derivative) via its command-line interface for
      headless batch slicing. HobbyMesh exports a 3MF file with
      print settings, calls the slicer CLI, and optionally displays
      a G-code preview. Requires no library dependency — works with
      whatever slicer is already installed.

    Phase B — 3MF round-trip (medium effort):
      Deep 3MF integration with embedded slicer profiles, print
      settings, and modifier meshes. The user configures print
      parameters inside HobbyMesh, exports a fully-configured 3MF,
      and the slicer CLI produces G-code in one step. Adds a slicer
      profile manager to HobbyMesh for storing and editing print
      presets.

    Phase C — Embedded slicer library plugin (long-term, high effort):
      Fork and strip the OrcaSlicer (or PrusaSlicer) codebase to
      extract a clean, embeddable slicing library with a stable C/C++
      API. Ship as an optional HobbyMesh plugin.

      This involves:
        - Removing the GUI layer (wxWidgets) and printer management
        - Isolating the slicing core from Boost/TBB/Clipper
          dependencies (or accepting them as plugin dependencies)
        - Defining a stable API surface: mesh in → sliced layers
          out, with configurable parameters for infill, supports,
          speed, temperature, etc.
        - G-code generation for common printer firmware (Marlin,
          Klipper, RepRapFirmware)
        - Ongoing maintenance to merge upstream algorithm
          improvements from PrusaSlicer/OrcaSlicer

      Estimated effort: 3-6 months for initial extraction, plus
      ongoing upstream tracking.

      Alternative: contribute the library extraction upstream to
      PrusaSlicer or OrcaSlicer. If accepted, the maintenance
      burden is shared with the upstream community. This has been
      discussed in both projects but never executed.

  LICENSING:

    The slicer plugin would be licensed under AGPL 3.0 (inherited
    from the OrcaSlicer/PrusaSlicer codebase). AGPL 3.0 is
    compatible with GPL 3.0 for linking purposes, so the plugin
    can be loaded by HobbyMesh (GPL 3.0) without license conflict.
    The AGPL's network clause (requiring source distribution for
    network services) has no practical impact on a desktop
    application. The plugin's AGPL license should be documented
    separately from HobbyMesh's GPL 3.0 license.

  PLUGIN ARCHITECTURE:

    The slicer integration should be an optional plugin, not a core
    dependency. Users who prefer their own slicer workflow (or who
    use resin printers with proprietary slicers) should not be
    affected. HobbyMesh's core functionality — mesh editing, repair,
    sculpting, Boolean operations — must work without the slicer
    plugin installed.
