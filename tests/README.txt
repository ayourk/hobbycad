  tests/ -- Unit and Integration Tests
================================================================================

  This directory will contain unit tests and integration tests for
  HobbyCAD. Test infrastructure will be added in a future phase.

  Planned test framework: Qt Test (QTest) for GUI components,
  Google Test or Catch2 for library-level unit tests.

  Until then, use devtest/ for build-time dependency verification.
